<blockquote>Box Hill is one of the best known features in the North Downs. Only 20 miles from the centre of London, it is a haven of natural beauty with more than a million visitors every year. Those numbers mean that special care is necessary to protect its many rare species of flora and fauna. The Friends of Box Hill is an independent association, affiliated to the Campaign to Protect Rural England. It is made up of people who love the Hill, and keep a close watch on everything that affects it.
